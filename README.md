# SQL_e_track

##Lessons learned:
This challenge I had trouble getting the connection set up with the database and linking it to the inquirer questions I had set up in my server.js file. I was a bit confused with how I was going to do all that based off of what the user response. I knew I needed to use some sort of if else statment but I went with a switch case statment becuase it looked cleaner and would work the same. with some tutoring help I got everything to work.


##Description
